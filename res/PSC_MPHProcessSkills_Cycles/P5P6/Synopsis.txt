MY PALS ARE HERE! Science Process Skills Primary 5&6 has been crafted for pupils to exercise the necessary skills and processes involved in scientific inquiry. Pupils are given the opportunity to identify and integrate the required set of skills and processes through a two-pronged progressive structure that has been embedded in these worksheets. Firstly, skills are learnt by encouraging pupils to carry out inquiries on scientific concepts in their study of Science. Secondly, more complex processes are explored in terms of breadth and depth through the challenging questions posed.
