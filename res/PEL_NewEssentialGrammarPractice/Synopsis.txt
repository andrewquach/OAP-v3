New Essential Grammar Practice is specially written to demonstrate the correct use of grammar in given contexts. Written according to the latest MOE English language syllabus, there are two parts in each grammar topic. The first part explains the usage of specific grammar items in context while the second part comprises exercises which help pupils to familiarise themselves with the items. The explanations on the use of the grammar items are clear and easy to understand. The exercises can be used to check whether pupils have learnt how to use the English language in a grammatically sound manner. As the grammar items are topically arranged, teachers, parents and pupils will find the books easy to use.
